title: About

Tea-totaler, librarian, and scientist of both information (MA) and computers
(BS + MS). Currently pursuing PhD in Computer Science, working with solver
technologies for string constraints with the goal of finding injection
vulnerabilities (among other things).

I wish I spoke lojban so that at least my internal monologues would be
syntactically unambiguous.
