title: About
---

Tea-totaler, librarian, and scientist of both information (MA) and computers
(BS + MS). Currently pursuing PhD in Computer Science, working with solver
technologies for string constraints with the goal of finding injection
vulnerabilities (among other things). Sometimes in the [Polonius working
group](https://rust-lang.github.io/compiler-team/working-groups/polonius/) of
the Rust compiler team.

I wish I spoke lojban so that at least my internal monologues would be
syntactically unambiguous.
