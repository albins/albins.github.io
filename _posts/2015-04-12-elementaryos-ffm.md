title: Focus-follows-mouse in ElementaryOS
---
I like the focus follows mouse focus behaviour. To set it in Elementary OS (including the recently released Freya), one can simply modify the GSettings database from a simple terminal command:
`gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences focus-mode 'sloppy'`.
